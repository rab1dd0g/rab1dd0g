# 👋 G’day, I'm Rob

Sparky-turned-coder from down under ⚡🧰  
I have a long term passion for IT, and I’ve swapped the toolbox for the keyboard — now building techy things that do the job right, no mucking around.

### 🔧 What I'm Up To

- Learning the ropes of full-stack web dev  
- Building real-world tools, not just to-do lists  
- Always keen to get stuck into a project that solves a problem

### 🧠 Still Learning

- Git and version control without breaking everything  
- JavaScript basics (and a few head-scratchers)  
- How to build, test, and launch small web apps  
- Deploying to shared hosting like cPanel — keeping it old-school but effective
